# Interactive-Image-Stitching-Tool-V2

An interactive Django web app for stitching images using **SIFT + RANSAC**, 
with statistical validation through hypothesis testing.  

The application dynamically visualizes:
- Feature points (scatter plots)
- Descriptor histograms
- Network graphs of matches
- Final stitched image (when validated)

- ## 🎥 Demo


## 🌟 Features
- Upload two images via a clean Django interface
- Extract SIFT features and compute 128-d descriptors
- Match features and reject outliers with RANSAC
- Hypothesis testing (t-test) for stitchability
- Dynamic visualizations of feature points and matches
- Dockerized deployment on AWS EC2
